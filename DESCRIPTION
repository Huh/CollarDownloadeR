Title: Automate downloading of telemetry data from manufacturer's websites
Description: At the time of this writing no telemetry "collar" manufacturer has 
    and easy to use API to automate the downloading of data.  To fixe this 
    problem we created this package to collect functions that leverage web 
    scraping to download data.  The interface is meant to be simple and 
    consistent.  The package requires that you have your own username and 
    password for the website you are attempting to contact.
